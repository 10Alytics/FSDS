- **Approach:** Add tags and metadata to all files for easier indexing and filtering.  

### **2. User Feedback Mechanism**  
- **Goal:** Allow users to provide suggestions for improvement directly from the platform.  
- **Approach:** Add a feedback template in `/usability` or enable GitHub Discussions for suggestions.  

### **3. Accessibility Compliance**

## **Proposed Usability Improvements**  
### **1. Interactive Tutorials**  
- **Description:** Convert static tutorials into interactive notebooks (e.g., Jupyter or Google Colab).  
- **Benefit:** Users can execute code directly and learn hands-on.  

### **2. Project Management Dashboard**  
- **Description:** Create a central dashboard to track active projects, their progress, and contributor roles.  
- **Benefit:** Encourages more structured collaboration and participation.  

### **3. Automated Contribution Checks**  
- **Description:** Set up pre-commit hooks or GitHub Actions to verify contributions for formatting, syntax, and completeness.  
- **Benefit:** Reduces the burden on maintainers while ensuring high-quality submissions.
